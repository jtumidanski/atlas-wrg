   <!-- mirrors | This is a list of mirrors to be used in downloading artifacts from remote repositories. | | It works like this: a POM may declare a repository to use in resolving certain artifacts. | However, this repository may have problems with
   heavy traffic at times, so people have mirrored | it to several places. | | That repository definition will have a unique id, so we can create a mirror reference for that | repository, to be used as an alternate download site. The mirror site will be
   the preferred | server for that repository. |-->
